<h3>U-Net for Image Segmentation:</h3>


Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves dividing an image into multiple segments, assigning each pixel a semantic label. This provides detailed information about the spatial extent and boundaries of objects in an image, making it useful in various applications. It is typically performed using deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks, which learn to extract high-level features and low-level details. The challenges of dealing with partially occluded or irregularly shaped objects are addressed by using multi-scale feature extraction and skip connections. Overall, semantic segmentation is a powerful technique with many practical applications in fields such as computer vision, robotics, and healthcare.
The goal of this project is to build UNet for semantic image segmentation. UNet was initially proposed for biomedical image segmentation, where it achieved state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmark datasets. Since then, it has been widely adopted in other fields such as remote sensing, robotics, and natural image segmentation.

One of the key innovations of UNet is its use of skip connections, which allow the decoder network to receive information from the corresponding encoder network at the same spatial resolution. This enables the decoder to fuse high-level semantic features with low-level details, leading to more accurate segmentation results.

Another advantage of UNet is its efficient use of memory. By using max-pooling and upsampling layers in the encoder and decoder networks, respectively, UNet is able to reduce the size of the feature maps while preserving the relevant information.

Overall, UNet has proven to be a versatile and effective approach for a wide range of image segmentation tasks. Its success has led to the development of many variants and extensions, such as the Attention UNet and the Residual UNet, which aim to further improve its performance on challenging datasets.
 
At the end of this project, we will be able to use the UNet to output segmentation masks that show which pixels of an input image are part of the background, foreground, and outline.
