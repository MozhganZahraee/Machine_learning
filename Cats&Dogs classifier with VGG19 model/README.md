In this project, a machine learning classifier was created using a pre-trained VGG-19 model and a dataset of images of cats and dogs. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets, and data augmentation was performed on the training set to increase the number of images and prevent overfitting. The convolutional base of the pre-trained model was frozen and used as a feature extractor, and the resulting features were fed through a global average pooling layer and a fully-connected classifier. The classifier was then fine-tuned by unfreezing the top layers of the model and training them along with the fully-connected layer. The resulting model achieved nearly 98% accuracy on the validation set and was able to make accurate predictions on new data from the test set.
