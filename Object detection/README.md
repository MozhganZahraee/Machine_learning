<h3>Object detection by using FasterRCNN + InceptionResNet V2 from Tensorflow Hub:</h3>


To create an object detection model using models from the TensorFlow Hub, I chose the Faster R-CNN with Inception ResNet V2 model, which is known for its high accuracy. TensorFlow Hub is a repository of pre-trained machine learning models that can be easily reused in your own projects. I loaded the model by specifying the module handle and checked the available signatures for the model, choosing the 'default' signature for my object detector. After loading the model, I downloaded an image and preprocessed it by resizing it to match the input size expected by the model. I then ran the object detector on the selected image and obtained bounding boxes for each detected object, along with their corresponding confidence scores. To evaluate the performance of the model, I performed inference on more images and calculated the intersection-over-union (IOU) metric, which measures the overlap between the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. By comparing the IOU scores against a threshold, I was able to determine whether the model was accurately detecting objects in the images. Overall, using pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub allowed me to create an object detection model quickly and with high accuracy, while also avoiding the need to train a model from scratch.
